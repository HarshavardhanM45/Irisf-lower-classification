The Iris Flower Classification task involves predicting the species of iris flowers (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It is a classification problem, commonly used for training and evaluating machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
